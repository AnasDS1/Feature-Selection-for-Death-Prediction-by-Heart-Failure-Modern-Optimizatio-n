# Feature-Selection-for-Death-Prediction-by-Heart-Failure-Modern-Optimizatio-n
This research was conducted to explore the key features playing remarkable role in life and death prediction during heart failure. We used Genetic Algorithm with three different crossover operators for feature selection. Decision Tree was used for classification. GA with uniform crossover performed well in this study.
